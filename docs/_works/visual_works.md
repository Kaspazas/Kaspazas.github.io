It's been a while since I actively used Photoshop or worked with visual content, I have some designs and works I'm proud of.

<h2> Babushka </h2>

I've designed a series of images featuring a Babushka, inspired by a discussion I had with a friend. Here's her hiding behind a fence:

To enrich the visual concept, I thought it'd be a good idea to segment the Babushka into various parts, where each one could be varied individually, resulting in __Baba Road__:

Lastly, to embrace the concept, here's a babushka selling strawberries:
