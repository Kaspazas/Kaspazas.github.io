It's been a while since I actively used Photoshop or worked with visual content, I have some designs and works I'm proud of.

<h2> Babushka </h2>

I've designed a series of images featuring a Babushka, inspired by a discussion I had with a friend. Here's her hiding behind a fence:

To enrich the visual concept, I thought it'd be a good idea to segment the Babushka into various parts, where each one could be varied individually, resulting in __Baba Road__:

Initailly, I used the Maxima logo on the bags, but figured I should remove it as seen in the first image and the one below.

Lastly, to embrace the concept, here's a babushka selling strawberries:

<h2> Photo restoration </h2>

Need to make the images smaller before uploading. 

<h2> Gifs, animated images </h2>
