Good day,  
Thank you for visiting my portfolio. 

Throughout my studies, I've placed heavy emphasis on various methods of analysing social media and I would like to highlight them here. I would also like to hight some projects I've been working on outside of studying, to satisfy curiosities and improve my programming/analytical skills.


NOTE THAT THIS SITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

May I suggest you check out my write up of my master's thesis [Automated Propoganda Posters](/projects/test-bots)?

Or the temporarily more complete [methods](/methodologies/) section.
